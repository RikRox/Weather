The day is displayed at the top of the planner. You have time blocks for hours 8 - 16 (8:00 - 4:00). The time blocks are color coded based on the current hour, previous hours, and future hours. You can input an event and hit the save button. Upon refresh your events will remain because they are saved to local storage.
